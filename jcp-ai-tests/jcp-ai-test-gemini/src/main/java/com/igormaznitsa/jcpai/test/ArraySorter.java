  //$"""//AI generated method
  //$"""AI> code level is Java /*$mvn.project.property.maven.compiler.release$*/
  //$"""AI> generate method implements fastest sort algorithm with minimal memory overhead, the speed is priority:
  //$"""AI>     public static int [] fastSort(final int [] array, final boolean asc)
  //$"""AI> where arguments are
  //$"""AI>   int [] array is array to be sorted
  //$"""AI>   asc is flag shows if true then ascending order for result, descending order otherwise
  //$"""AI> it returns the same incoming array if it is null, empty or single value array, else returns new version of array with sorted values.
  //$"""AI> the method should contain whole implementation of sort algorithm without any use of third side libraries, helpers and utility classes
  //$"""AI> can't have additional methods and functions, all implementation must be as the single method
  //$"""AI>
  //$"""AI> special requirements and restrictions:
  //$"""AI> 1. the method has javadoc header description
  //$"""AI> 2. don't add code comments into the method body
  //$"""AI> 3. don't use both single line comments and block comments inside the method code
  //$"""AI> 4. if any import needed then use canonical class name and don't add import section
  //$"""AI> 5. the result is only method, iy must not be wrapped by class or interface
  //$"""AI> 6. the method must be fast and implement effective algorithm but it should be enough compact
